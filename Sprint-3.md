title: Sprint 3 ‚Äì Authentication & Production Release
revision: v1 ¬∑ 16 June 2025
---

> **Context**  
> *Sprint 2 delivered a containerized application with basic model training and prediction capabilities, but lacks authentication, complete model management, and several critical UI components. Sprint 3 completes the project by implementing authentication, fixing structural issues, and preparing the final deliverable.*

## 2 ¬∑ Sprint Goal (definition of success)

Deliver a **production-ready application** that:
1. **Fixes critical structural issues**: Model synchronization, complete input forms, and multi-model selection
2. **Implements full authentication**: JWT-based signup/login with role-based access control (admin vs user)
3. **Meets all project requirements**: Complete feature set as specified in Project Requirements document
4. **Passes quality gates**: E2E test coverage, browser compatibility, and CI/CD pipeline
5. **Delivers presentation materials**: Demo video and presentation slides for final submission

**Week 1 Focus:** Critical fixes and codebase stabilization  
**Weeks 2-3 Focus:** Authentication implementation and presentation preparation

---

## 3 ¬∑ Critical Issues (Week 1 Priority)

### üö® Epic A: Model Management Synchronization
**Problem:** Models exist as pickle files in model service but aren't visible in admin console due to backend-model service disconnect.

### üö® Epic B: Complete Calculator Input Form  
**Problem:** Missing fare (0-500$) and title (Master, Miss, Mr, Mrs, Rare) inputs in survival calculator.

### üö® Epic C: Multi-Model Selection & Prediction
**Problem:** No model selection UI; professor requires ability to run multiple models in single prediction call.
