<!-- 
> Note 1: This is a university project, so make total dev hours 70.
> Note 2: The devs named @dv, @fe, @kr and @sk are very inexperienced, no field experience, no practical, nor theoretical experience. They need exposure to real, solvable problems, but require more time and structure. @ha and @lm are very experience, so give them the tasks that are of highest specialist difficulty and priority, stuff that senior devs know from experience, not a book.
> Note 3: I absolutely love the tone and format of Sprint-1, so use it and improve it. 
> Note 4: Tasks that haven't been completed yet, move them to Sprint-2 (they are currently work in progress).
