## 1. Sprint Overview

**Sprint Goal:** 
Finalize the MVP and deliver a **complete, production-ready version** of the Titanic Survivor Prediction Application that includes all major features and integrated services (frontend pages, backend prediction logic, ML model pipeline, admin console, marketing/advertisement integration, and Docker Compose orchestration), **while** incorporating user account or authentication flows. This sprint focuses on finalzing the MVP, expanding the application to include user authentication, and etc. (still a work in progress).

**Key Deliverables:**

## 2. Sprint Objectives

Draft 0:
- Let Denisa and Fares finish working on the frontend pages and the backend prediction logic. (aka. B2 and C2)
- Due to Sameer being busy with his other project, he will have to work double time to finish the model microservice epics. (aka. D1 and D2)
- Let Kazi work on the login and signup pages. Maybe even setup the authentication flow.
- Have Huraira revise and improve the once finished B2 and C2.
- Have Lev work on A2, as the professor has just released `cicdtoken`.

<!-- 
> Note 1: This is a university project, so make total dev hours 70.
> Note 2: The devs named @dv, @fe, @kr and @sk are very inexperienced, no field experience, no practical, nor theoretical experience. They need exposure to real, solvable problems, but require more time and structure. @ha and @lm are very experience, so give them the tasks that are of highest specialist difficulty and priority, stuff that senior devs know from experience, not a book.
> Note 3: I absolutely love the tone and format of Sprint-1, so use it and improve it. 
> Note 4: Tasks that haven't been completed yet, move them to Sprint-2 (they are currently work in progress).
